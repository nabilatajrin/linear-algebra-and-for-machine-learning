# linear-algebra-and-for-machine-learning

Key Concepts:
-Recall how machine learning and vectors and matrices are related
-Interpret how changes in the model parameters affect the quality of the fit to the training data
-Recognize that variations in the model parameters are vectors on the response surface - that vectors are a generic concept not limited to a physical real space
-Use substitution / elimination to solve a fairly easy linear algebra problem
-Understand how to add vectors and multiply by a scalar number


The relationship between machine learning, linear algebra, and vectors and matrices:



Vector
A vector may refer to any of the following:


1. In computer programming, a vector is either a pointer or an array with only one dimension.

2. In mathematics, a vector is a quantity with both a magnitude and direction.

3. In computer graphics, the term vector describes a line with a starting and ending point. See our vector graphic term for further information.

4. In computer security, the term attack vector refers to a particular method for exploiting a system vulnerability.
